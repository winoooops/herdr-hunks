# The plugin's [[build]] step. Its only contract is to leave a working binary at
# target/release/herdr-hunks.
#
# Herdr runs build commands during `plugin install`, and nothing says a build
# command has to compile — so this fetches a published release asset when one
# matches the platform, and compiles when anything at all goes wrong. Every
# failure path falls back to `cargo build --release`, which is what this step
# used to do unconditionally: the worst case is the old behaviour, never a
# failed install.
